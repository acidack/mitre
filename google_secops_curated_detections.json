[{"name":"Security Command Center","versions":{"attack":"12","navigator":"5.1.1","layer":"4.5"},"domain":"enterprise-attack","description":"Security Command Center (SCC) provides analysts with a centralized dashboard for cyber situational awareness by aggregating threat and vulnerability reports. SCC works by scanning for weaknesses or monitoring an organization's logging stream for anomalies (e.g., Google Workspace logs, containers, vulnerabilities in web applications, and hypervisor-level instrumentation). To further mitigate risks in the infrastructure, SCC easily integrates with other Google Cloud security solutions: Cloud DLP, Chronicle, Binary Authorization, Cloud Armor, and 3rd party solutions (e.g., SIEM, SOAR). The cyber-attacks in this solution are correlated to SCC's premium tier which included additional security features for: Event Threat Detection, Container Threat Detection, Virtual Machine Threat Detection, Web Security Scanner, and Security Health Analytics","filters":{"platforms":["Linux","macOS","Windows","Network","PRE","Containers","SaaS","IaaS","Azure AD","Office 365","Google

dashboard for cyber situational awareness by aggregating threat and vulnerability reports. SCC works by scanning for weaknesses or monitoring an organization's logging stream for anomalies (e.g., Google Workspace logs, containers, vulnerabilities in web applications, and hypervisor-level instrumentation). To further mitigate risks in the infrastructure, SCC easily integrates with other Google Cloud security solutions: Cloud DLP, Chronicle, Binary Authorization, Cloud Armor, and 3rd party solutions (e.g., SIEM, SOAR). The cyber-attacks in this solution are correlated to SCC's premium tier which included additional security features for: Event Threat Detection, Container Threat Detection, Virtual Machine Threat
